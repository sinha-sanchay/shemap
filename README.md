## ðŸ“Š What It Does

- Accepts any Indian district as input (via dropdown).
- Predicts safety **risk level**: High, Medium, or Low.
- Shows top 5 reported crimes in that district.
- Displays a visual bar chart using Plotly.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Model Training (Offline)**  
   A supervised learning model (RandomForestClassifier) was trained using district-wise crime data from 2017 to 2022.

2. **Input from User**  
   You select a district â€” the app fetches relevant data, calculates the mean stats, and uses the trained model to predict the risk.

3. **Results**  
   - Risk level (color-coded).
   - Top crimes with counts.
   - Bar graph of top 5 crimes.
